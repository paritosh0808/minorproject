# minorproject
In this project we explore Respresentational Learning in Multi-layer Networks. We aim to apply state-of-the-art feature learning
algorithms to a multi-layer blood tissue dataset whose nodes are Entrez gene IDs and edges represent protein protein interactions

The "embeddings" folder contains embeddings created with each algorithm and

The "blood-data" folder contains the blood-tissue PPI dataset with the layers and the hierarchy
